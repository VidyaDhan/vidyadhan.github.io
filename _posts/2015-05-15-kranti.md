There are other organisations doing great work for girls in India, checkout the [Kranti website](http://www.kranti-india.org/).

Here is an excerpt from the Kranti website:-

"Kranti is an NGO that empowers girls from the red-light district of Mumbai to become agents of social change. Kranti believes that, when girls like us have access to the same education, training, and opportunities as people from privileged backgrounds, we can become exceptional leaders."
