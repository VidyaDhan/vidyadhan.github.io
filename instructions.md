## Hosting

This site is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) (the world's most popular code hosting site) for free.

You can view the site directly on GitHub at this address: [http://vidyadhan.github.io](http://vidyadhan.github.io).

When ready, a custom domain name can be used instead.

It is a static website (so no maintenance or security concerns :smile:), but supports easy blogging thanks to Jekyll.

(if you're of a technical mind, you might like to read lots more about the [Jekyll templating engine](http://jekyllrb.com/)).


## Creating pages / blog posts

For ease of use, pages and blog posts can be created as ".html" files or as ".md" files ("Markdown" files).

Markdown is best:

* it's much easier to write! 
* you can just use a simple text editor (no need for any expensive programs).

Here's a [cheat sheet for Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) which shows you how to make links, lists etc.

The site will turn the Markdown pages you create into nice HTML for you _automatically_.

And don't worry, if you ever need to, you can also include HTML code directly in the Markdown files (so you get the best of both worlds)! You can [read more about Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p).

But do remember this:

**Any markdown file for this site must include the special top section which is demarcated by two lines with three dashes**

This section is called "Front Matter". You can just copy a section from an existing document.

### Blog posts

Blog posts are just files. They must go in the "_posts" directory.

The filename is special though. It must be in the format of the other posts already there.

i.e. YYYY-MM-DD-title.md

### Images

**This is the web so make sure you re-size any images you use before you upload them (otherwise people on mobiles will curse you!)**

I'd recommend a maximum of 640 pixels, but you could go for 1024 if needed.

To link to an image from your blog post, just use a normal HTML image tag. You can use the "width" attribute to make it appear at a smaller size if needed. You can also add class="popup" to make it clickable.

### How to edit content? Create pages? Upload images?

* Create a free account on GitHub.
* Let me know your account name and I'll authorize it
* Then you'll be able to edit the files directly in your browser
* you will see the results directly! (no need to run a publish step)
